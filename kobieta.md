# Sleeping woman  
  
I sit up in bed at night and listen to you snore   
  
I met you in a bus station and now I wonder at your back   
sick white and stained with children’s freckles   
as the lamp divests the unsolvable sorrow of the world upon your sleep.   
  
I cannot see your feet but I must guess that they are   
most charming feet.   
who do you belong to?   
are you real?   
  
I think of flowers, animals, birds   
they all seem more than good   
and so clearly real.   
yet you cannot help being a   
woman. we are each selected to be   
something. the spider, the cook.   
the elephant. it is as if we were each   
a painting and hung on some   
gallery wall.   
  
— and now the painting turns   
upon its back, and over a curving elbow   
I can see a mouth, one eye and   
almost a nose.   
the rest of you is hidden   
out of sight   
but I know that you are a   
contemporary, a modern living   
work   
perhaps not immortal   
but we have   
loved.   
please continue to   
snore.
