I  
  
O that we might be our ancestors’ ancestors.  
A clump of slime in a warm bog.  
Life and death, fertilizing and parturition  
Would be all the functions of our silent juices.  
An algal leaf or a sand dune,  
Shaped by the wind and basal and heavyset.  
Even a dragonfly’s head or a gull’s wing  
Would be too evolved and suffer too much.  
  
II  
  
Contemptible are the lovers, the mockers,  
All despair, yearning, and hope.  
We are such painfully plague-ridden gods,  
And yet we think of God a lot.  
The soft bay. The dark forest dreams.  
The stars, snowball blossom big and heavy.  
Panthers lope silently among the trees.  
Everything is strand. Forever calls the sea—
